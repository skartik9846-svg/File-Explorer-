# File-Explorer-
This project, titled “File Explorer in C++,” is a command-line 
based application that simulates basic file management 
operations such as listing, creating, copying, moving, 
searching, and deleting files or folders. The project was 
developed step-by-step over five days using modern C++17 
features such as the <filesystem> library, chrono-based 
logging, and fstream for file I/O.
Each day of development added new features to make the file 
explorer more functional and realistic.
