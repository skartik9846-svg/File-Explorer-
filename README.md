# File-Explorer-
This project, “File Explorer in C++,” is a command-line  based application that simulates basic file management  operations such as listing, creating, copying, moving,  searching, and deleting files or folders. It is developed step-by-step over five days using modern C++17  features such as the &lt;filesystem> library, chrono-based  logging, etc.
